This branch for ML System Optimization assignment. 

This programming assignment has two parts

Part-1: Explore Distributed Machine learning using PyTorch DDP
Part -2: Explore the TDML framework (Trustworthy Distributed Machine Learning ) using Blockchain-based Data Parallelism

We have 2 source files
1. we run code on using CPU
2. we run code on using GPU

Conducted comprehensive experiments showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed framework TDML against two baseline techniques. 
Experimental results show that our TDML framework surpasses the performance limitations of FedAvg and matches the baseline performance of single-node training.

Added converted .html and pdf files for the reference.
